# JottPad v2.0

A revamped Edition of my previous js project with many added features.


## Appendix

This iteration of JottPad makes use of AngularJs framework while completely rendering from the MaterialUI components.
The App still makes use of browser side interaction (localStorage) to store and manage data.
I am currently working on the BackEnd using NodeJs and MongoDB.
I will be sure to implement the changes in the next update.

Do Star the repo if you liked my work and want to appreciate.
;)
